# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview

The goal in this challenge was to analyze product reviews from Amazon, comparing those from users paid to review products through their Vine program, and those from unpaid users. The aim of the analysis was to determine whether any bias exists in the number of reviews that receive five stars depending on whether the reviewer was part of the paid Vine program or not. Due to considerations of time, computing power, and storage capacity, analyzing reviews across the vast array of products available from Amazon would be impractical. So, for the purposes of this challenge, only reviews of video game products on Amazon's U.S. website were considered. The set of reviews was pared down further to include only those reviews which received at least 20 votes, and where at least 50% of those votes indicated that the review was helpful.
